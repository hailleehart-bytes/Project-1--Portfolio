## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
The site contains the following pages:
- `portfolio.html` (Home)
- `about.html` (About Me)
- `skills.html` (Skills)
- `projects.html` (Projects)
- `contact.html` (Contact Me)

Each page demonstrates HTML structure, semantic elements, and styling using external CSS.

## Site Structure
- **Semantic Tags:** `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` were used.  
- **Navigation:** Consistent across all pages.  
- **Footer:** Includes email and copyright.  
- **Form Validation:** Required fields, pattern check for phone numbers.

## Design and GUI

### Responsive Design
The design uses **fluid layouts** and **media queries**.  
- **Breakpoint used:** `max-width: 768px`  
- **Purpose:** Ensures the navigation and sections adapt properly to mobile and tablet views.

### Gradients Used
- A **linear gradient** (`linear-gradient(180deg, rgb(225, 225, 225), rgb(229,102,78))`) was used in the **header** section to create depth and color blending.

### Color Scheme
Created using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create):
- **Sky Blue:** `rgb(70,191,224)`  
- **Grapefruit Red:** `rgb(229,102,78)`  
- **White:** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)`  

These colors provide a modern, clean contrast, increases readablitly with visible text and add a modern touch
